Hello!
My name is Silas Eacret (a.k.a. EekRats),
and I consider myself to be a programmer,
gamer, developer, DIY-er, Follower of Papa Musk,
space enthusiast, IT guy, and repair man.
I am 14 years old and I live in rural Wisconsin,
a dozen or so miles outside of a town called Spring Green.
I spend most of my time playing video games, fixing computers either for profit or enjoyment,
programming, or looking through the electronics sections of thrift stores. I also
do a lot of work on my investments, both regular stocks as well as cryptocurrencies (#dogecoin).
I work mainly with Unity/C#, but I also know a bit of Java, Javascript, C, x86 Assembly, C++, Lua, and more.
I know a bit about Blender, but not enough to be more useful than making little animations for already made 3D models.
